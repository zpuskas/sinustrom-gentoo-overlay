What is happening?
==================

sinustrom overlay has migrated from Github[1] to Codeberg[2].

All future updates will happen in the Codeberg repository. The Github
version has been archived as of today, and will receive no further
updates.

The Github repository will be deleted on 2026-09-01.

If local settings are not updated to the new location by the date
above, repository syncing will start throwing an error. Installed
ebuilds should continue to work until changes in ::gentoo break it.

User Action Required
====================

Users using any ebuilds from the sinustrom overlay need to re-add the
repository. If using the 'eselect' tool then:

    eselect repository remove sinustrom
    eselect repository enable sinustrom

If the overlay was added manually instead of using 'eselect', then the
'sync-uri' in the relevant conf file in '/etc/portage/repos.conf' needs
updating from 'github.com' to 'codeberg.org', like so:

    [sinustrom]
    sync-uri = https://codeberg.org/zpuskas/sinustrom-gentoo-overlay

Non 'eselect' users also must delete the existing checkout and re-sync:

    rm -rf /var/db/repos/sinustrom
    emerge --sync sinustrom

This will ensure continued support and new updates to all ebuilds in
the overlay. There is no need to rebuild already emerged ebuilds from
the sinustrom overlay after this migration.
